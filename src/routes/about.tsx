          This page is maintained by the Clean Start team to answer common privacy

          practices — it isn't a legal certification or independent audit.

            When you sign in, we store your account identifier and an optional persona
            (renter, homeowner, curious). When you chat, we store your messages, the
            assistant's replies, and any reports you generate so you can come back to
            them later. We don't ask for your address, income, utility account, or
            other sensitive identifiers.

            Your sessions, messages, and reports are private to your account. Database
            access is enforced with row-level security so that only you — signed in —
            can read or modify your own data. The Clean Start team can't read your
            conversations through the app interface.

          >
            Your messages are sent to a hosted AI provider through a server-side
            gateway to produce replies. The provider's API key is never exposed in
            your browser. We don't use your conversations to train models, and we
            don't share them with third parties for marketing.
